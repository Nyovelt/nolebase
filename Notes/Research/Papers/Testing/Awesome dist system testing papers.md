- **Anvil: Verifying Liveness of Cluster Management Controllers**
	- Tianyin Xu, OSDI 24 Best Paper
	- A **formal verification** framework to verify the correctness (not only the safety, but also the *liveness*) of Kubenetes Controller
- **Acto: Automatic End-to-End Testing for Operation Correctness of Cloud System Management**
	- Tianyin Xu, SOSP 23
	- An end-to-end tester for Kubenetes Operators.  Acto continuously instructs an operator to reconcile a system to **different states** and **checks** if the system success-fully reaches those desired states. 
- **Push-Button Reliability Testing for Cloud-Backed Applications with Rainmaker**
	- Tianyin Xu, NSDI 23
	- Automatic restful **api fault hijacking and injection**
	- Related works:  fault injection techniques and error-handling analysis for cloud apps testing
- **Automatic Reliability Testing for Cluster Management Controllers**
	- Tianyin Xu, OSDI 22
	-  Automated reliability testing for Kubenetes controller, by **Systematic Perturbation Testing** and **Differential Test Oracles**
- **Testing Configuration Changes in Context to Prevent Production Failures** (CTest)
	- Tianyin, OSDI 20
	- CTest tested configuration changes by re-do tests related to the configuration change context, and ctest can be generated from existing tests.
- **Do Not Blame Users for Misconfigurations**
	- Tianyin, SOSP 13
	- Using **Static Analysis** to Infer Configuration Constraints

- **Efficient Exposure of Partial Failure Bugs in Distributed Systems with Inferred Abstract States**
	- Peng (Ryan) Huang, NSDI 2024
	- Use static analysis to automatically infers abstract states from distributed system code to make fault injection. It use **Budgeted-State-Round-Robin (BSRR) Algorithm** to guide fault injection decisions.
- **Run-Time Prevention of Software Integration Failures of Machine Learning APIs**
	- Shan Lu, OOPSLA 2023
	- preventing integration failures in software applications using **machine learning (ML) APIs**
		- exceptions, mismatching ....

- **Automated Verification of Idempotence for Stateful Serverless Applications**
	- Haibo Chen, OSDI 2023
	- **Verification** of Idempotence for Serverless
- **Fail through the Cracks: Cross-System Interaction Failures in Modern Cloud Systems**
	- Tianyin Xu, Yongle Zhang, EuroSys 23
	- Cloud system reliability is affected not only bythe reliability of each individual system, but also by the interplay between these systems. 
	- Open-Source CSI Failure **Dataset**
	- Cross-System Testing: check whether the two systems, Spark and Hive, each process data consistently by writing the data and then reading it through various interfaces of the two systems.
- **Understanding and Detecting Software Upgrade Failures in Distributed Systems**
	- Shan Lu, Yongle Zhang, Ding Yuan, SOSP 21
	- A **static checkers** DUPChecker 
	- Related Work:  automated testing
	- we designed a static checker DUPChecker to search for two types of data-syntax incompatibility across versions: 
		- (type-1) on data defined by serialization libraries and 
		- (type-2) on data of enum types,
- **Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures**
	- Ding Yuan, Yongle Zhang, OSDI 14
	- We ex-tracted three simple rules from the bugs that have lead to some of the catastrophic failures, and developed a **static checker**, Aspirator, capable of locating these bugs
