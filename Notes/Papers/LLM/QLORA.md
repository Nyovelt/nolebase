# QLORA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs
## What are the _motivations_ for this work?
Finetuning large language models (LLMs) is a highly effective way to improve their performance, and to add desirable or remove undesirable behaviors. However, finetunning a large language model can be prohibitively **expensive**. 


## Concepts Learned:
### Double Quantization
### Low-rank Adapter weights
