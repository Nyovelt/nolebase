# RTP Food Map
## Chinese Food
#### Akari Express
- Location: https://maps.app.goo.gl/yLQTLFcNQRYex3W28
- My rating: 4.5 / 5
- Reviews: 
	- The service attitude of Akari is the best I've seen in a Chinese restaurant. This alone has decided that I will often bring people to eat there.

	- It is said that the chef of the Akari comes from Shanghai Alley. However, in terms of taste, it is qualified.
