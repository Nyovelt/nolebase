### Tier 0: Take advantage of every opportunity.
#### US Bank Altitude Reserve (UAR)
4.5 % on everything? Too good to be true.
### Tier 0.5: Everyone should have
#### Chase Sapphire Preferred Card (CSP)
The CSP is the core of the Chase trilogy and the UR (Chase Ultimate Rewards) system. The UR system has point transfer partner like **Hyatt**, which makes UR more valuable and available than other reward systems.

To put it simply, CSP is a mid-level card you'll obtain early on. It's a Visa card, and you are likely to keep it forever, it deserves a slot in your small wallet.
#### American Express Gold Card (Amex Gold)
With 4x points on dining and grocery purchases (capped at $25,000 per year), free additional cards, and AMEX's exceptional service, this card is truly excellent. And it's easy to get.

Don't forget its **return protection**, **purchase protection** and **Extended Warranty**. 

I will consider using this credit card when I purchase expensive electronic products like MacBook Pro or regular items on Amazon or TEMU. **For all "entities", I will put the expenses on this card, as well as dining and grocery.** Note that second-hand, open box and refurbished items are not covered by warranty.

Cathy Pacific is a good point transfer partner for AMEX as I will annually fly and return from China.

Sometimes you can open Gold for multiple times.



#### Tier 1: Worth holding for the long term.
#### Chase Ritz-Carlton Credit Card (Ritz)
The Ritz card offers travel insurance the same to the Chase Sapphire Reserve. I'll use this card to rent a car and book a flight. 

The main insurance coverage of a credit card includes:
- Trip Delay Insurance (delay 6h), need to use Ritz to buy the ticket
- Baggage Guarantee (6h)
- Travel Accident Insurance (include medical)
- Car Rental Insurance (Secondary, CDW/LDW, Roadside Assistance)

Moreover, it also offers PPS.

#### Citi Strata Premier 
When you've maxed out the $25,000 cap on your Amex, you'll need four such cards.

#### Tier 1.5: Inevitable Path

#### No Annual Fee Functional Card
- Chase Freedom Flex
- Discover
- Citi Custom Cash & Citi Double Cash
- Chase Freedom Unlimited

These cards are only used for a few days a year.

#### Chase Marriott Bonvoy Boundless
A critical dependency to Ritz. Usually have high SUBs.

### HSBC Elite
5x for all travel? Too good to be true.


## Tier 2: 
### AmEx Platinum

### Chase Sapphire Reserved

### Bilt
### Amex Hilton Aspire
## Tier 3
### Aero Cards
Unless you live near a hub. 
### AmEx Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant

### Chase IHG Premier

### Chase World of Hyatt

## Tier 4: shit cards
- Citi Costco
