# OLT Guide
OLT.com, short for OnLine Taxes, is an IRS-authorized e-file provider offering tax preparation software.
I use OLT because I am **NRA** and it can **e-file**.

## What form should I choose
form 1040-NRÂ is used by nonresident alien individuals, estates, and trusts to file a U.S. income tax return.
