# OLT Guide
OLT.com, short for OnLine Taxes, is an IRS-authorized e-file provider offering tax preparation software.

As a non-resident alien (NRA) navigating U.S. taxes, I've found OLT.com to be an invaluable resource. OLT.com offers IRS-authorized e-filing options tailored for NRAs like myself. While I initially hoped for a completely electronic filing process, I discovered I still needed to mail in my tax forms, a minor hiccup in an otherwise smooth experience.

## Choosing the Right Form
Nonresident alien individuals, estates, and trusts should turn to **Form 1040-NR** for U.S. income tax filings. This form accommodates the unique aspects of our tax obligations.

## Key Considerations for NRAs
### Do you want to file Form 8840?
Filing Form 8840 can significantly reduce your tax liability and simplify your tax filings by asserting a closer connection to a foreign country than to the U.S., indicating no migration intentions.
### Do you want to file Form 8843?
If you're here on an **F**, **J**, M, or Q visa, filing Form 8843 is crucial. It exempts you from the Substantial Presence Test, potentially altering your tax status.

As a student, I filled both 8840 and 8843.

#### Enter the number of days in 2023 you claim you can exclude for purposes of the substantial presence test
As an F-1 student, you'll likely exclude all days present in the U.S. during the year from the Substantial Presence Test.
