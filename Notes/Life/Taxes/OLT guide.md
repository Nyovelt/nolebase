# OLT Guide
OLT.com, short for OnLine Taxes, is an IRS-authorized e-file provider offering tax preparation software.

As a non-resident alien (NRA) navigating U.S. taxes, I've found OLT.com to be an invaluable resource. OLT.com offers IRS-authorized e-filing options tailored for NRAs like myself.

## Choosing the Right Form
Nonresident alien individuals, estates, and trusts should turn to **Form 1040-NR** for U.S. income tax filings. This form accommodates the unique aspects of our tax obligations.
