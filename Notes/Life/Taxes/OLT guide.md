# OLT Guide
OLT.com, short for OnLine Taxes, is an IRS-authorized e-file provider offering tax preparation software.

I use OLT because I am **NRA** and ~~it can **e-file**~~. (It eventually turns out that I still need to deliver tax forms by mail)

## What form should I choose
form 1040-NRÂ is used by nonresident alien individuals, estates, and trusts to file a U.S. income tax return.

## Personal Info
### Do you want to file Form 8840?
The benefit of filing form 8840: Less tax liability and simpler tax filings. It may indicate you do not have any intention for migration.
### Do you want to file Form 8843?
**If you are a student** on an F, J, M, or Q visa, and you are in the U.S. for any part of the year, you need to file Form 8843 to claim your exemption from the Substantial Presence Test.

#### Enter the number of days in 2023 you claim you can exclude for purposes of the substantial presence test
As an F-1 student, you would typically exclude all the days you were present in the U.S. during the year.


## W-2
You will receive a form from your university. Fill it in. 

Do not forget **treaty article 20(c)**. Pay attention to your wages. 
There are two scenarios:

1. You only got a W-2 (NC State did)
After filling W-2, Done with W-2, Choose **exempt under treaty**. First, fill Schedule OI. Next, choose No for "Do you have wages on W-2 box 1 that is already reduced by the tax treaty exemption"

2. You got W-2 (without withhold of $5000) and a 1040-S
	Complete your W-2 as normal, but for the 1042-S should be completed with a **statement of exempt under treaty**, followed by a statement of $5,000 in 1040NR OI, with an article code of 20(c).
## Fidelity - 1099-DIV

- SSN can be used for TIN (Tax Identification Number)

A flat tax of 30 percent (or lower treaty) rate is imposed on U.S. source capital gains in the hands of nonresident alien individuals present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year. This 183-day rule bears no relation to the 183-day rule under the substantial presence test of IRC section 7701(b)(3). This rule applies even if any of the transactions occurred while you were not in the United States.

<!-- ![](https://webresources.aaaab3n.moe/share/7701b3.png) -->

- In this case, since I didn't stay for 183-day in US during 2023, the tax rate is 0% for me (And likely to be 30% for 2024). (Update: cannot find source, I still apply 30% tax rate).
- Reminder [this](https://www.uscardforum.com/t/topic/227991), Fidelity's SPAXX investment has about 30% is for the US government obligations. 
- Remember to put the same amount in the state tax section as well (except for CA and NY, they don't deduct)

## 1099-INT and 1042-S
If you submit Form W-8BEN that indicate that you are a NRA, to your bank or investment institution, you should receive Form 1042-S. (I received it from Chase.) Or, you will get 1099-INT. (I got it from Fidelity). 

### 1099-INT
Don't fill, attach it.
### 1042-S
Just fill. Choose Code 10 (Interest) for SCHEDULE OI.

## 1040NR - SCHEDULE OI
Choose "YES" to "Were you subject to tax in foreign country on any of the income show above"
