# OLT Guide

OLT.com, short for OnLine Taxes, is an IRS-authorized e-file provider offering tax preparation software.

As a non-resident alien (NRA) navigating U.S. taxes, I've found OLT.com to be an invaluable resource. OLT.com offers IRS-authorized e-filing options tailored for NRAs like myself. While I initially hoped for a completely electronic filing process, I discovered I still needed to mail in my tax forms, a minor hiccup in an otherwise smooth experience.

## Choosing the Right Form

Nonresident alien individuals, estates, and trusts should turn to **Form 1040-NR** for U.S. income tax filings. This form accommodates the unique aspects of our tax obligations.

## Key Considerations for NRAs

### Do you want to file Form 8840

Filing Form 8840 can significantly reduce your tax liability and simplify your tax filings by asserting a closer connection to a foreign country than to the U.S., indicating no migration intentions.

### Do you want to file Form 8843

If you're here on an type **F**, **J**, **M**, or **Q** visa, filing Form 8843 is crucial. It exempts you from the Substantial Presence Test, potentially altering your tax status.

As a student, I filled both 8840 and 8843.

#### Enter the number of days in 2023 you claim you can exclude for purposes of the substantial presence test

As an F-1 student, you'll likely exclude all days present in the U.S. during the year from the Substantial Presence Test.

## Reporting Income

### W-2 Forms

Your university will provide a W-2 form. Remember to apply treaty article 20(c) to your wages. The process changes slightly depending on whether you received only a W-2 or also a 1042-S.

1. You only received a W-2 (that's what NC State University did)
2. After done with W-2, Choose **exempt under treaty**. First, fill Schedule OI. Then, choose **No** for "Do you have wages on W-2 box 1 that is already reduced by the tax treaty exemption"

2. You got W-2 (without a withhold of $5000) and a 1040-S
3. Complete your W-2 as normal, but for the 1042-S should be completed with a **statement of exempt under treaty**, followed by a statement of $5,000 in 1040NR OI, with an article code of 20(c).

### Dividends and Interest

For dividends (reported on Form 1099-DIV) and interest, nonresident aliens face a default 30% tax rate, subject to reductions under tax treaties.

#### 1099DIV

- SSN can be used for TIN (Tax Identification Number)
- A flat tax of 30 percent (or lower treaty) rate is imposed on U.S.

- Reminder [this](https://www.uscardforum.com/t/topic/227991), Fidelity's SPAXX investment has about 30% is for the US government investment.
- Remember to put the same amount in the **state tax section** as well (except for CA and NY)

## 1099INT and 1042S

If you submit Form W-8BEN that indicate that you are a NRA, to your bank or investment institution, you should receive Form 1042-S. (I received it from Chase.) Or, you will get 1099-INT. (I got it from Fidelity).

### 1099INT

Attach it at the end.

### 1042S

Choose Code 10 (Interest) for SCHEDULE OI.

### 1040NR SCHEDULE OI

Choose `YES` for "Were you subject to tax in foreign country on any of the income show above"
