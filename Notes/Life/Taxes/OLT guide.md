# OLT Guide
OLT.com, short for OnLine Taxes, is an IRS-authorized e-file provider offering tax preparation software.
I use OLT because I am **NRA** and it can **e-file**.

## What form should I choose
> form **1040-_NR_**Â is used by nonresident alien individuals, estates, and trusts to file a U.S. income tax return.

## Personal Info
### Do you want to file Form 8840?
The benefit of filing form 8840: Less tax liability and simpler tax filings. It may indicate you do not have any intention for migration.
### Do you want to file Form 8843?
> **If you are a student** on an F, J, M, or Q visa, and you are in the U.S. for any part of the year, you need to file Form 8843 to claim your exemption from the Substantial Presence Test.

#### Enter the number of days in 2023 you claim you can exclude for purposes of the substantial presence test
> As an F-1 student, you would typically exclude all the days you were present in the U.S. during the year.
