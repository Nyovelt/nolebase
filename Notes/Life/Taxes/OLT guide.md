# OLT Guide
OLT.com, short for OnLine Taxes, is an IRS-authorized e-file provider offering tax preparation software.
I use OLT because I am **NRA** and it can **e-file**.
## What form should I choose
> form **1040-_NR_**Â is used by nonresident alien individuals, estates, and trusts to file a U.S. income tax return.

## Personal Info
### Do you want to file Form 8840?
The benefit of filing form 8840: Less tax liability and simpler tax filings. It may indicate you do not have any intention for migration.
### Do you want to file Form 8843?
> **If you are a student** on an F, J, M, or Q visa, and you are in the U.S. for any part of the year, you need to file Form 8843 to claim your exemption from the Substantial Presence Test.

#### Enter the number of days in 2023 you claim you can exclude for purposes of the substantial presence test
> As an F-1 student, you would typically exclude all the days you were present in the U.S. during the year.

## W-2
You will receive a form from your university. Fill it in. 

Do not forget **treaty article 20(c)**. Pay attention to your wages. At NC State, they minus $5000 from your actual wage (6 months, $9960 = $2600 * 6 - $5000), then complete your W-2 as normal, but for the 1042-S should be completed with a **statement of exempt under treaty**, followed by a statement of $5,000 in 1040NR OI, with an article code of 20(c).
